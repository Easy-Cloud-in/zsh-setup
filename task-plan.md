# Safety-First Task Plan (feature/safety-first branch)

## Overview

This task-plan focuses on Phase 2 (Error Handling & Safety) improvements to ensure robust error handling and protect user data. Tasks are grouped by priority and organized into markdown tables for clarity.

### Core Phase 2 Tasks

| Task Description                                                             | File Involved                                 | Status         | Priority |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| Implement system error logging to `~/.zsh-setup.log`                         | All scripts                                   | ❌ Not Started | High     |
| Add backup confirmation prompt before modifying config files                 | `zsh_oh_my_posh_setup.sh`                     | ❌ Not Started | High     |
| Create rollback functionality for failed installations                       | `uninstall.sh`                                | ❌ Not Started | Medium   |
| Warn before overwriting custom `.zshrc` configurations                       | `zsh_oh_my_posh_setup.sh`                     | ❌ Not Started | High     |
| Validate disk space before downloads                                         | `install_fonts.sh`, `zsh_oh_my_posh_setup.sh` | ❌ Not Started | Medium   |
| Handle edge cases in theme block removal (multiple/malformed config entries) | `change_posh_theme.sh`                        | ❌ Not Started | Medium   |

### Supporting Phase 1/3 Tasks

These are included as dependencies for proper safety implementation:

| Task Description                                   | File Involved             | Status         | Priority |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| Add non-interactive `--dry-run` flag               | All scripts               | ❌ Not Started | Medium   |
| Validate user theme selection input                | `zsh_oh_my_posh_setup.sh` | ❌ Not Started | Medium   |
| Add config file section markers (BEGIN/END blocks) | `.zshrc`, `.bashrc`       | ❌ Not Started | High     |

## Implementation Notes

1. All critical scripts (`zsh_oh_my_posh_setup.sh`, `uninstall.sh`) require error logging setup first
2. Backup logic should be implemented using `cp -v --backup=simple` with confirmation prompt
3. Rollback should restore from backups in `~/.zsh-setup-backups/`

To start, I recommend beginning with the **High Priority** Phase 2 tasks listed above. Would you like me to now:

1. Create the `feature/safety-first` branch
2. Begin implementing the first task (error logging)
